# Negative-Affect-and-Personality-Project
Summary:

It is important to carefully consider missing values in a data set before drawing conclusions from the results of an analysis. Conclusions based on data that are systematically missing may only apply to a small subset of the broader population the conclusions are intended to appply to. In this project, we use personality and affect data to demonstrate a statistical method that accounts for the cause of the missing values. We show that the conclusions drawn from the results of an analysis that does not account for the cause of the missing values are different from the results of an analysis that DOES account for the cause of the missing values. 

The R scripts are for calculating reliability (greatest lower bound) of the personality and negative affect scales. 

The .inp file is an Mplus input file for fitting the structural equation model of interest. 

The .out file is an Mplus output file containing the model results. 

The Powerpoint files provides a summary of the project.
